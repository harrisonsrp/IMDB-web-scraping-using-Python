Carmencita,/user/ur3914439/,Horst_In_Translation," Hurt by lack of sound and color
","Here and there you find a short movie which may have been not considerably better if they had music and color available back in the last years of the 19th century, but this one is pretty much the exact opposite. Carmencita is still showing us a nice dance and giving us a beautiful smile, but the effect of this one would have been so much better with the wild Spanish or Latin music she was listening and colors that make her gorgeous dress look even more majestic. Still it's an okay early effort from Dickson and a good watch for silent film enthusiasts with an unusually high running-time of 45 seconds for Dickson's movies from that year. I t looks like so much fun how she's wildly shaking her arms and legs and I'd definitely have loved to join in in her dancing."
Pauvre Pierrot,/user/ur23577930/,Irishchatter," A hidden gem from the late 1800s
","I absolutely didn't realise this was the first animation to be created and be shown to audiences, until it was recommended by Youtube for me to give this a watch. Even if the speed wasn't on point, there was no sound or we don't hear the characters talking in this short film, it really stood out anyways! I have to say, fairplay to Émile Reynaud for creating this because like, it really is a good introduction to animation that we know today and the fact, even if it was plain and simple, it really is eye-catching plus interesting. This little short would be good to watch if you wanna learn baby steps of early animation works or have nothing to do but wanna try to watch something new. I give this a 8/10!"
Un bon bock,/user/ur0264325/,PIST-OFF," cinematic masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!
","until this film came along the use of motion picture had been mostly hobby of gadgetry for the rich and idle. the idea that stories could be told through the medium of film was as distant an alien as one could be. the this came out in 1892, and what by today's standards would be considered a short film with little as far as plot or anything else would instead set some of the key components of film that would developed over the next twenty years and finalized by DW Grifith early in the twentieth century. If you can find an archival institution that has this film, find it and see. For the first attempts at translating theater to the silent screen. All the primordial aspects of film from direction, plot, narrative, action, arch, development, acting, et cetera exist in this movie in some form or another.10 out 10, with historical bias"
Blacksmith Scene,/user/ur13134536/,Michael_Elliott," Edison: Invention of Movies
","Blacksmith Scene (1893) Barber Shop, The (1893) These two Edison shorts are more ""film like"" than previous items from the studio, which were pretty much just camera tests. In the first film we see three men hammering some iron before taking a break and passing a beer around. The second short has three men sitting around a barber shop with one of them receiving a shave. Once again these two are basically going to be for those wanting to see early examples of history so coming to either one of these films for entertainment, as we use the word today, would be quite useless. I find watching these other films to be quite entertaining because of anything Edison could have filmed, they thought audiences would want to see this."
Corbett and Courtney Before the Kinetograph,/user/ur40334238/,cricket30," This is the GWTW of the first wave of movies!
","Yup. ""The Corbett-Courtney Fight was the most profitable film subject of the kinetoscope era"" (if an ""era"" can last just 10 months!) ""and Corbett himself received more than $15,000 over the course of its commercial life"" states the film notes guy in the 4-disc Kino set titled EDISON: THE INVENTION OF THE MOVIES. Therefore, before GONE WITH THE WIND was an all-time American box-office champ, before TITANIC, before AVATAR (and before James Cameron's PARENTS even were born!), CORBETT AND COURTNEY BEFORE THE KINETOGRAPH held that soon-to-be-coveted distinction. Thankfully, this did not last very long. It was too much of a mouthful, and it sounds not dissimilar to MATA HARI BEFORE THE FIRING SQUAD. Like the latter eye-catching title, this 1894 offering from Edison Manufacturing Company featured the violence for which EMC always has been known. EMC produced three genres of films: 1)pure violence, 2)pure sex, and 3)sex and violence mixed together. The moms of America could take their pick!"
Edison Kinetoscopic Record of a Sneeze,/user/ur2403620/,douhaveasista," Great Drinking Movie!!!
","Dude! You've got to see this movie. It's funny when it needs to be, but serious. It's a gut-buster, yet a tear jerker. Best movie of the summer! The acting is fantastic, and the chemistry between the characters is mesmerizing. It was like I was in the movie. Intelligent script, great writing by the writers. This movie is a must-see!! I'm gonna get this on DVD as soon as it comes out. I am awestruck at the spectacle of this great future American classic. It's just fun. I'm glad I spent the money on this movie, heck I think I would've paid triple what I paid just to see this gem. A must-see in my book, so go see this if you want all the ingredients for a great drinking movie."
Miss Jerry,/user/ur0781506/,johnny-m," The Illusion of Motion
","While both in USA and in Europe directors were producing one-shot short films, merely of a documentary nature, Alexander Black had produced (arguably) the first feature of moving pictures. The photoplay 'Miss Jerry' tried its best to create the illusion of motion, with the slides changing once every 15 seconds, while Black was effortlessly providing the voice for every character. Despite the handicap of the format, 'Miss Jerry' holds well if compared to a plethora of films that followed after it. The credit has to go to the script, which provides a charming portrayal of a countryside girl, Geraldine Holbrook who decides to become a reporter. The romance developing between the main character and her editor is remarkably subtle, refusing over dramatisation. Both Blanche Bayliss and William Courtenay provide memorable stills, their emotions managing to transcend the barriers of the photos, ultimately vibrating in the eyes of the viewer. Unknowingly, Alexander Black had set a number of themes and motives, as well as scenes, that became cliché long after the tour of 'Miss Jerry' finished in 1907. It offered a glance in the future of film-making, when the Lumière brothers saw no use in motion pictures. The sight was delightful."
La sortie de l'usine Lumière à Lyon,/user/ur3878635/,kobe1413," Lumiere's first film to be viewed by the public...
","Auguste Lumiere and Louis Lumiere place their camera outside of the Lumiere family factory. We see the doors of the factory open and its workers begin to file out. Some of the workers acknowledge the family by staring at it and others move along without noticing it.The Lumiere Brothers were the first filmmakers of France and, along with the Edison group and Birt Acres and Robert W. Paul, were the helped introduce the world to moving film. The Lumieres were more interested in filming real people in real situations than the Edison, who were quickly interested in filming narrative scenes.YOU WILL LIKE THIS FILM IF YOU LOVED: ""The Sea (1895)"" IF YOU HATED: ""Norma Rae"""
